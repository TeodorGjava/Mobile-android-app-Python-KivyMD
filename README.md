# Mobile-android-app-Python-KivyMD
<h2>Quick preview</h2>
The idea ðŸ’¡ of the application was born in my head long time ago, as i mentioned in my profile info,
I'm currently working in a company that import and sell liquid supplement for concrete, 
test materials and create optimised concrete receipts and return to clients concrete samples
results after crushing them on hydraulic press testing lab.
However we test our new receipts by creating smaller scale mixture on small concrete machine.
We keep the proportion of materials needed for one cubic meter concrete, and recalculating them
for lets say 20 or 25 liters mixture.
The process of calculations for each receipt is done by hand one by one for each material, 
which was the main reason for me to search a way to simplify the whole process of calculations.
I used kivyMD to create the UI ðŸ“², and under the hood there are calculating processes for each field with 
user input returning calculated values at once, faster and without human mistake factor.
