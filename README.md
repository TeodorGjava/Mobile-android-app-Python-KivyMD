# Mobile-android-app-Python-KivyMD

## Description 
As a distributor of admixtures for concrete we often test new products or the current
listed products for quality assurance. To take samples to test we need to mix different
volumes of concrete following the recipe for one cubic meter, we calculate the amount
of aggregates for the needed volume.

The problem was all the calculations were made mannualy one by one with calculator,
this was taking way too much time in preparation and includes human factor mistakes.
Leading to low performance and wasted.

ðŸ’¡ I figured out a solution using a python library called kivyMD to create the UI ðŸ“², making an android app that
calculates all given aggregates for the needed volume meter, and some additional data
like sum of all aggregates, amount of admixture and more. The app was deployed the
app at November 2021 and since then it's used frequently. Recently released English
version.
